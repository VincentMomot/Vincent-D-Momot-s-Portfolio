Vincent D-Momot's Portfolio

Description: This website is to keep a log of my professional work for future reference and to showcase my skills to future employers.

Website Features:
1) An Introduction page with Contact Information in the Footer
2) A resume page for download access and in browser viewing.
3) A games page which showcases two games I created from Scratch.
4) A work page which shows work from this class that I am proud of, work from Iowa State University, and other related work.
5) A contact tab that will bring the user back to the home page and scroll down to the Contact Me section.
6) Alt descriptions on all images if a link is broken.
7) @media queries for users with different sized screens.
8) In the Contact Me section, my LinkedIn and GitHub links are also provided.
9) In the work section, a secondary website (My First Website) is deployable for users.



What I learned from the creation of this site:
+calling elements in the CSS document to target what I need changed
+media queries' notation and functionality
+embeding links into images
+adding iframe elements to play Scratch games
+better understanding of "border-box" and the box-model
