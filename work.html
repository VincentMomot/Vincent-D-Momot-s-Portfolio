        <p>The three blue foam images are for a project to develop a drone to fly over crop fields to evaluate crop health.</p>
        <p>This involved using a windtunnel to gather experimental data to back up our claims on the performance of the wing.</p><br/>

        <img src="Assets/plane.jpg" alt="Partially Assembled UAS">
        <p>A team that I lead was called the JARVIF team. We designed and constructed a UAS in only two month's time</p>
        <p>This was a reaserach project to check the accuracuy of AAA software which is used in commercial aircraft evaluation. </p>

        <p>This competition team won first place. We were given a baloon to carry 85% of the aircrat's weight and then fly through an obstacle cource.</p>
        <p>I was in charge of piloting the UAS, programming the controller, and some construction. </p>

        <p>These images showcase my SolidWorks skills using only a 12" ruler and a waterbottle to take measurements on.</p>
        <p>With this project, I learned how to apply screw constraints and render images to look more impressive.</p>
